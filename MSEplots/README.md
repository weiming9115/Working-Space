### MSEplots project
pip install MSEplots-pkg
------
A package built for the MSE analysis of sounding data/ model output which provides required vertical profiles of thermodynamic parameters.

1. Required paramters: Air temperature, Dewpoint, Pressure, Altitude. NOT specifically for sounding data!
2. Functions are provided for deriving thermodynamic variables eg. potential tmeperature and static energy. Easy for further calculations and not exclusively for plotting only.
3. Plotting options: thermo.plots, theta.plots, and mesd_plots.

More tests are needed to see if the calculated CAPE based on corresponds "quantitatively" and "graphically" to the MSE plot.
