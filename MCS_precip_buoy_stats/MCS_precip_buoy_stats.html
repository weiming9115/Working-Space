<h3>MCS Precipitation and Buoyancy Diagnostic</h3>
<p>
  This POD provides diagnostics of tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and their thermodynamic environments,
  informed by an empirical buoyancy measure (<em>B</em><sub>L</sub>). Specifically, these diagnostics are designed to evaluate model
  performance in representing basic spatial-temporal characteristics of tropical MCSs and associated precipitation responses to the buoyancy measure under MCS and non-MCS conditions. The diagnostics include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tropical-mean precipitation.</li>
  <li>MCS frequency and its contribution to total precipitation.</li>
  <li>Sensitivity of precipitation to individual buoyancy components, evaluated separately for MCS and non-MCS conditions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Unlike traditional parcel-based buoyancy, the <em>B</em><sub>L</sub> measure incorporates vertical thermodynamic
  structure and deep-inflow, mass-flux–driven entrainment processes in the lower troposphere.
</p>
<p>
  Tropical MCSs are identified using outgoing longwave radiative flux and precipitation, following similiar
  definitions implemented in
  <a href="https://github.com/FlexTRKR/PyFLEXTRKR">PyFLEXTRKR</a>.
Instead of tracking clouds continuously in time, the default cloud identification method is “snapshot-based.” Users may alternatively provide pre-identified MCS masks to bypass the identification step and proceed directly with the remaining MCS diagnostics.
</p>

<p><strong>About the POD:</strong></p>
  <li>
    A minimum of one year of data at 3-hourly temporal resolution is recommended to ensure a sufficient sample size of tropical MCSs.
  </li>
  <li>
    This POD is designed for models with relatively high horizontal resolution (≤ 0.5°). Conservative regridding is applied by default to ensure consistent comparisons between model outputs and the observational reference (GPM-IMERG + ERA5).
  </li>
  <li>
    Detailed descriptions of the POD are documeneted in "diagnostics/MCS_precip_buoy_stats/doc/MCS_precip_buoy_stats.rst"
